* What is "logic programming"?
** declarative - describing the "what" not "how" of a system
** logic is expressed in terms of relations, represented as *facts* and *rules*
** computations are performed by querying the relations
* Anatomy of Prolog
** terms - atoms, numbers, variables, compound terms
*** atoms - general purpose name with no inherent meaning
*** numbers - float or integers
*** variables - placeholders for arbitrary terms, begin w/ uppercase or underscore
*** compound term - "functor" and "arguments"
**** special cases - lists: [red, yellow, blue]; strings "this is a string"
** clauses - facts and rules
*** Head :- Body.
**** read "Head is true if Body is true"
**** Body is a list of predicates
*** fact
*** rule
** queries
*** is garfield a cat?
*** what things are cats?
* Use Cases for Logic Programming
** AI
** computational lingustics
** other rules engines
*** family trees
*** medical diagnoses
* Encore! Encore! Encore!
